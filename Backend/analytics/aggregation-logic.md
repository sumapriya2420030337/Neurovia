# Aggregated Analytics Logic

Purpose:
Provide institutions with insights without exposing individuals.

Metrics Generated:
- Total sessions per day
- Count of high-anxiety sessions
- Count of crisis-level flags
- Stress category distribution
- Time-based trends

How It Works:
- Firestore queries aggregate counts
- No raw chat or text is processed
- Data is displayed as numbers and charts only

This ensures ethical data usage.
